# "Stock_Market_Prediction" Project Overview

📈 Delving into Stock Price Forecasting Using LSTM 🚀

In this endeavor, I embarked on an intriguing exploration of the field of stock market analysis and prediction, harnessing the capabilities of the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model.

Key Technologies Utilized:

🐍 Python for thorough data preprocessing, manipulation, visualization, and proficient model implementation.

📓 Jupyter Notebook as my chosen coding environment, providing an interactive and efficient platform for development.

🧠 Employing the Keras library, I meticulously designed and trained the LSTM model to enhance predictive accuracy."
